# Telegram Library Bot

## Переписываю бота, ведь все там устарело

The project is being developed for my edu-startup(taplink.cc/collegehub) as a pet-project, which I do in free time. 

The main of the project is to create a telegram bot that will help high-school students with the search of materials(eBooks, tutorials, and videos)
for IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, and ACT preparation.

The technologies that I'll be using: Python, SQLite, and aiogram framework.


...The documentation will gradually get updated. Keep tuned!
